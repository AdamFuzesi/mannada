# Extension Icons

This directory contains the icons for the browser extension.

You need to create three PNG icons:
- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels  
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

These should feature a robot/AI assistant design with a meeting/calendar theme.

You can create these icons using:
1. Online tools like Canva or Figma
2. Icon generators
3. Professional design software

For now, you can use emoji-based placeholder icons or download free icons from:
- Icons8 (https://icons8.com)
- Flaticon (https://www.flaticon.com)
- Font Awesome (https://fontawesome.com)

Make sure the icons have a transparent background and look good on both light and dark backgrounds.
